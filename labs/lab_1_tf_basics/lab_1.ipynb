        "One way to derive feedforward neural networks is to begin by saying \"I'd like to do a simple (linear) transformation on my input features to make them easier to model, then use a simple model (e.g. linear regression) that instead uses the transformed features.\"\n",
        "Doing this means your total model is $y = ABx + b$ where $B$ is the matrix multiplying an input point $x$ into a new representation and $A$ is the matrix parameterizing the linear regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "But, $AB$ is just another matrix, and so by adding a representation you have not made your model more powerful; instead if you'd \"twisted\" the input space after appyling B, the overall map would be nonlinear and the composite model would have greater representation power.\n",
        "Activation functions perform this \"twisting\".\n",
        "Deep neural networks come from the observation that it'd be easier to get a good representation (top layer) if it was based on a lower-level representation (early layers).\n",

        "Here's a great article explaining the geometric interpretation of activation functions: https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/.\n",
        "The general idea is that neural networks can learn parameters that use the \"twists\" such that the entire network deforms space so that the manifold defined by your input data is simple. "
